# Portfolio Web Site

This is a web application which documents my project portfolio explaining a few of my projects. 
It consists of a Home page, About Me page, Projects, Services, Contact and login pages.
The login page manages access to a secure section of the site that displays my contact list.
The contact list is stored in a backend database which is connected to the site.
## Features

- NodeJS was used as the back-end JavaScript environment
- CSS was used for styling of the web pages
- Mongo DB was used for storing data and other CRUD operations
- JavaScript was used for the front-end development
